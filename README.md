# eCommerceV2
This is an adapted version of an eCommerce course I followed on Udemy <br>
code of which can be found here: [coding for entrepreneurs Ecommerce](https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/eCommerce)

#Setup
if you clone this repo be sure to rename: <br>
.env_ to .env <br>
local.py_ to local.py <br>
<br>
Once done you can fill in the variables in .env as and when you need them
